## About

This is an extension for customizing folder colors in Unity editor. Although there are many good assets that include editing folder icons or fancy extra features, I wanted to keep it simple and only change the color, while also saving the settings at the editor preference level rather than within the Unity project itself.

## Installation

You can install the package using Unity's package manager.
